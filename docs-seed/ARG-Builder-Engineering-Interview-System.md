## 2. Assessment Design Philosophy

### 2.1 Guiding Principles

| Principle | Rationale | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Predict job performance | Assessments must test actual work skills | Use real-world problems from our domain |
| Minimize false negatives | Great engineers fail bad interviews | Multiple assessment formats, candidate choice |
| Respect candidate time | Senior engineers have options | Maximum 5 hours total process |
| Reduce bias systematically | Unconscious bias distorts signal | Structured rubrics, diverse panels, blind review |
| Create positive experience | Every candidate is a potential customer/referrer | Clear communication, timely feedback, respect |
| Assess growth trajectory | Potential matters as much as current skill | Include learning-oriented questions |

### 2.2 What We Assess vs. What We Don't

| We Assess | We Don't Assess |
|-----------|----------------|
| Problem-solving approach | Memorized algorithm solutions |
| Code quality and readability | Speed of typing |
| System design trade-off thinking | Specific technology trivia |
| Communication and collaboration | Whiteboard performance anxiety |
| Learning ability and curiosity | Years of experience (as proxy for skill) |
| Domain-relevant technical skills | Puzzle-solving ability |
| Production-readiness thinking | Academic computer science depth |
