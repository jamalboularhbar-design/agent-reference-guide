### 3.1 Referral Flow

```
Step 1: Referrer shares unique link/code
    ↓
Step 2: Prospect clicks link → lands on dedicated page
    ↓
Step 3: Prospect signs up for demo/trial (referral tracked)
    ↓
Step 4: Sales team engages (referrer notified)
    ↓
Step 5: Prospect becomes customer (referral validated)
    ↓
Step 6: Rewards distributed to both parties
    ↓
Step 7: Referrer notified of reward + encouraged to refer again
```
