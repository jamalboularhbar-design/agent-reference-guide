# ARG-Builder: Sales Engineering Playbook

## Technical Pre-Sales Strategy, Demo Methodology, POC Framework, and Technical Win Criteria

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Sales Engineers (SEs) are the bridge between customer technical requirements and ARG-Builder's capabilities. In enterprise deals, the SE is often the difference between a technical win and a competitive loss. This playbook defines the SE role, demo methodology, proof-of-concept framework, and technical objection handling for ARG-Builder's sales process.

## 3. Discovery Framework (Technical)

### 3.1 Technical Discovery Questions

**Current State:**
- "Walk me through your current documentation/knowledge management stack."
- "How many tools are involved in creating and maintaining operational content?"
- "What's your current content creation workflow — who creates, reviews, and approves?"
- "How do you handle version control and content freshness?"

**Technical Requirements:**
- "What are your SSO/authentication requirements?"
- "Do you have specific data residency or compliance requirements?"
- "What systems would ARG-Builder need to integrate with?"
- "What's your security review process for new SaaS vendors?"

**Success Criteria:**
- "If we could solve this perfectly, what would success look like in 6 months?"
- "What are the must-have vs. nice-to-have requirements?"
- "Who needs to sign off on the technical evaluation?"
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"

### 3.2 Technical Qualification Checklist

## 5. Proof of Concept (POC) Framework

### 5.1 POC Decision Criteria

**When to offer a POC:**
- Enterprise deal (> $100K ACV)
- Technical complexity requires hands-on evaluation
- Multiple stakeholders need to experience the product
- Competitive evaluation where demo alone is insufficient
- Customer's procurement process requires it

**When NOT to offer a POC:**
- Deal is < $50K ACV (offer extended trial instead)
- Customer is using POC to delay decision
- No clear success criteria defined
- No executive sponsor identified
- Competitive deal already lost on non-technical grounds

### 5.2 POC Structure

| Phase | Duration | Activities | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Planning | 3–5 days | Define scope, success criteria, timeline | POC plan document |
| Setup | 2–3 days | Configure environment, integrations, data | Ready environment |
| Execution | 10–15 days | Customer uses product, SE supports | Usage data, feedback |
| Evaluation | 3–5 days | Review results against criteria | Evaluation report |
| Decision | 3–5 days | Present findings, propose next steps | Go/no-go decision |

**Total POC Duration:** 3–4 weeks (never exceed 30 days)

### 5.3 POC Success Criteria Template

| Category | Criterion | Measurement | Target | Weight |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Functionality | Core use case works as expected | Pass/fail per scenario | 100% pass | 30% |
| Performance | Response time acceptable | Page load, generation speed | < 5 seconds | 15% |
| Integration | Connects to required systems | Successful data flow | All critical integrations | 20% |
| Usability | Users can accomplish tasks independently | Task completion rate | > 85% | 15% |
| Quality | Generated content meets quality bar | Expert review score | > 4/5 | 15% |
| Security | Passes security review | Questionnaire completion | All critical items | 5% |

### 5.4 POC Governance

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Maximum 30 days duration | Prevents indefinite evaluation |
| Written success criteria before start | Prevents moving goalposts |
| Executive sponsor required | Ensures decision authority |
| Weekly check-in calls | Maintains momentum |
| No scope expansion without re-scoping | Prevents scope creep |
| Clear go/no-go decision at end | Forces conclusion |
| Limited to 2 concurrent POCs per SE | Quality focus |

## 6. Technical Objection Handling

### 6.1 Security Objections

| Objection | Response | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| "Is our data safe?" | "We encrypt all data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Your data is isolated in dedicated tenancy. We're SOC 2 certified." | SOC 2 report, security whitepaper |
| "Where is data stored?" | "All data is stored in [US/EU] on AWS/GCP infrastructure. We can accommodate data residency requirements." | Architecture diagram |
| "Can your employees access our data?" | "Access is strictly controlled via RBAC with audit logging. No employee can access customer data without explicit authorization and logging." | Access control policy |
| "What about AI data usage?" | "Your data is never used to train models. It's processed in isolated environments and never shared across customers." | Data processing agreement |

### 6.2 Integration Objections

| Objection | Response | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| "We need it to work with [system]" | "We have a robust API and webhook system. Let me show you our integration architecture and how it connects to [system]." | API documentation, integration examples |
| "Our tech stack is complex" | "We're designed for enterprise environments. Here's how similar companies with [similar stack] have integrated." | Case study, architecture diagram |
| "We need custom integrations" | "Our API supports custom workflows. For enterprise customers, we also offer professional services for complex integrations." | API docs, PS offering |

### 6.3 Scalability Objections

| Objection | Response | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| "Can it handle our volume?" | "We serve customers with [X]K+ users generating [Y]K+ documents. Our architecture auto-scales to handle peak loads." | Performance benchmarks |
| "What about uptime?" | "We guarantee 99.9% uptime SLA with redundant infrastructure across multiple availability zones." | SLA document, status page history |
| "What if AI quality degrades at scale?" | "Our AI models are optimized for enterprise scale. Quality actually improves with more organizational context." | Quality metrics at scale |

### 6.4 Competitive Objections

| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Counter |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Confluence/Notion | Established, familiar | "Those are blank canvases. ARG-Builder generates complete systems. It's the difference between a blank Word doc and a finished consulting deliverable." |
| Custom internal tool | Tailored to their needs | "Custom tools require ongoing maintenance. ARG-Builder evolves autonomously, saving your engineering team hundreds of hours." |
| Consulting firms | Human expertise | "We deliver consulting-quality output at SaaS pricing, continuously — not a one-time engagement that becomes stale." |
| Document AI tools | AI-powered | "They help with individual documents. We generate entire operational systems with cross-references, hierarchies, and continuous updates." |
