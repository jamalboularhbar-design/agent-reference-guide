## Vendor Evaluation Framework

### Evaluation Criteria (Weighted Scoring)

|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Feature fit | 25% | Does it solve our specific problem? | Demo with our use case |
| Total cost of ownership | 20% | All-in cost over 3 years? | Pricing, implementation, training, maintenance |
| Integration capability | 15% | Works with our existing stack? | API quality, pre-built integrations |
| Security & compliance | 15% | Meets our security standards? | SOC 2, encryption, access controls |
| Scalability | 10% | Grows with us to 10x scale? | Pricing at scale, performance limits |
| Vendor stability | 10% | Will they exist in 3 years? | Funding, revenue, customer base |
| Support quality | 5% | Responsive when things break? | SLA, support channels, escalation |

### Decision Matrix Template

| Vendor | Feature (25%) | Cost (20%) | Integration (15%) | Security (15%) | Scale (10%) | Stability (10%) | Support (5%) | **Total** |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Vendor A | 4 (1.0) | 3 (0.6) | 5 (0.75) | 4 (0.6) | 4 (0.4) | 5 (0.5) | 4 (0.2) | **4.05** |

## Negotiation Playbook

### Negotiation Levers

| Lever | When to Use | Expected Discount |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Annual prepayment | Cash available, vendor stable | 15–25% |
| Multi-year commitment | High confidence in vendor | 20–35% |
| Case study/reference | Early-stage vendor | 10–20% + extras |
| Volume commitment | Predictable growth | 10–30% |
| End-of-quarter timing | Vendor's fiscal quarter end | 15–25% |
| Competitive alternative | Genuine alternative exists | 10–20% |
| Startup/growth program | Revenue < $10M | 25–50% (first year) |
| Strategic partnership | Mutual value creation | Custom terms |

### Negotiation Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Never accept first price | List price is always negotiable in B2B SaaS |
| Get 3 quotes minimum | Creates competitive pressure and market knowledge |
| Negotiate on value, not just price | Payment terms, SLA, support, features matter |
| Document everything in writing | Verbal promises are worthless |
| Walk away willingly | Best leverage is genuine willingness to choose alternative |
| Time the negotiation | End of quarter/year yields best discounts |
| Start with annual, negotiate to monthly | Understand true cost before committing |
