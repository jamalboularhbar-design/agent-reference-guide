---

## 1. Purpose

This glossary establishes the single source of truth for how ARG-Builder defines, calculates, and reports every business metric. Consistent definitions prevent misalignment between teams, ensure accurate investor reporting, and enable meaningful benchmarking against industry standards.

---

## 2. Revenue Metrics

### MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)

> **Definition:** The total predictable revenue normalized to a monthly amount from all active subscriptions, excluding one-time fees, professional services, and variable usage charges.

**Formula:** Sum of (each customer's monthly subscription amount)

**Components:**
- **New MRR:** Revenue from customers acquired this month
- **Expansion MRR:** Additional revenue from existing customers (upgrades, seats, add-ons)
- **Contraction MRR:** Reduced revenue from existing customers (downgrades)
- **Churned MRR:** Revenue lost from customers who cancelled
- **Reactivation MRR:** Revenue from previously churned customers who return

**Calculation Rules:**
- Annual contracts: Divide annual amount by 12
- Multi-year contracts: Use annual rate divided by 12
- Discounts: Use discounted (actual) amount, not list price
- Free trials: Excluded until conversion to paid
- Pilots: Included only if paid

---

### ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)

> **Definition:** MRR × 12. Represents the annualized run-rate of recurring revenue.

**Formula:** ARR = MRR × 12

**Important Notes:**
- ARR is a point-in-time metric (snapshot, not cumulative)
- Does not include one-time revenue, even if predictable
- Used for valuation multiples and investor reporting

---

### ACV (Annual Contract Value)

> **Definition:** The average annualized revenue per customer contract, including recurring subscription fees.

**Formula:** ACV = Total new ARR booked in period / Number of new contracts in period

**Distinction from ARR:**
- ARR = total recurring revenue (all customers)
- ACV = average per-deal value (new bookings)

---

### ARPA (Average Revenue Per Account)

> **Definition:** Total MRR divided by total number of paying customers.

**Formula:** ARPA = Total MRR / Number of paying customers

**Segmentation:** Calculate separately for Starter, Professional, and Enterprise tiers.

---

### TCV (Total Contract Value)

> **Definition:** The total value of a contract over its full term, including all recurring and one-time fees.

**Formula:** TCV = (Monthly recurring × contract months) + one-time fees

---

## 3. Growth Metrics

### MRR Growth Rate

> **Definition:** Month-over-month percentage change in MRR.

**Formula:** (Current month MRR - Previous month MRR) / Previous month MRR × 100

**Benchmarks:**
- Early stage (< $1M ARR): > 15% MoM
- Growth stage ($1M–$10M ARR): > 8% MoM
- Scale stage (> $10M ARR): > 5% MoM

---

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

> **Definition:** The percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers over a period, including expansion and contraction, but excluding new customer revenue.

**Formula:** NRR = (Beginning MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Beginning MRR × 100

**Benchmarks:**
- Below average: < 100%
- Average: 100–110%
- Good: 110–120%
- Excellent: 120–130%
- Best-in-class: > 130%

**ARG-Builder Target:** 125%

---

### Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)

> **Definition:** The percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, excluding expansion (only measuring contraction and churn).

**Formula:** GRR = (Beginning MRR - Contraction - Churn) / Beginning MRR × 100

**Note:** GRR can never exceed 100%. It measures your ability to keep existing revenue.

**Benchmarks:**
- Below average: < 85%
- Average: 85–90%
- Good: 90–95%
- Excellent: > 95%

---

### Quick Ratio (SaaS)

**Benchmarks:**
- Unhealthy: < 1.0 (shrinking)
- Acceptable: 1.0–2.0
- Good: 2.0–4.0
- Excellent: > 4.0

---

## 4. Customer Metrics

### Logo Churn Rate (Customer Churn)

> **Definition:** The percentage of customers who cancel their subscription in a given period.

**Formula:** Customers lost in period / Customers at beginning of period × 100

**Calculation Rules:**
- Monthly: Customers churned this month / customers at start of month
- Annual: 1 - (1 - monthly churn rate)^12
- Exclude free trials and pilots from denominator
- A customer is "churned" on the date their subscription ends (not cancellation request date)

---

### Revenue Churn Rate (Dollar Churn)

> **Definition:** The percentage of MRR lost from churned customers in a given period.

**Formula:** MRR lost from churned customers / Beginning MRR × 100

**Distinction from logo churn:** Revenue churn can differ significantly if large or small customers churn disproportionately.

---

### Net MRR Churn

> **Definition:** Revenue churn offset by expansion from surviving customers.

**Formula:** (Churned MRR + Contraction MRR - Expansion MRR) / Beginning MRR × 100

**Note:** Negative net churn means expansion exceeds losses — the holy grail of SaaS.

**ARG-Builder Target:** Negative net churn (-5% or better)

---

### Customer Lifetime

> **Definition:** The average duration a customer remains a paying subscriber.

**Formula:** 1 / Monthly churn rate (in months)

**Example:** 1.5% monthly churn → 1/0.015 = 67 months average lifetime

---

## 5. Unit Economics

### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

**Segmentation:** Calculate blended AND by channel/segment.

---

### LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)

> **Definition:** The total gross profit expected from a customer over their entire relationship.

**Formula:** LTV = (ARPA × Gross Margin) / Monthly Churn Rate

**Alternative formula (with expansion):**
LTV = ARPA × Gross Margin × Customer Lifetime × (1 + Annual Expansion Rate)

**ARG-Builder Calculation:**
- ARPA: $5,200/month
- Gross Margin: 82%
- Monthly Churn: 1.5%
- LTV = ($5,200 × 0.82) / 0.015 = $284,267

---

### LTV/CAC Ratio

> **Definition:** The ratio of customer lifetime value to acquisition cost, measuring return on acquisition investment.

**Formula:** LTV / CAC

**Benchmarks:**
- Unsustainable: < 1x (losing money on each customer)
- Break-even: 1x
- Minimum viable: 3x
- Healthy: 3–5x
- Strong: 5–10x
- May be under-investing in growth: > 10x

- Acceptable: 0.5–0.75
- Efficient: 0.75–1.0 (invest more in growth)
- Very efficient: > 1.0 (significantly increase investment)

---

---

### Rule of 40

> **Definition:** The sum of revenue growth rate and profit margin should exceed 40% for a healthy SaaS business.

**Formula:** Revenue Growth Rate (%) + EBITDA Margin (%) ≥ 40

**Interpretation:**
- High growth + losses: Acceptable if sum > 40 (e.g., 100% growth + -40% margin = 60)
- Moderate growth + profit: Acceptable if sum > 40 (e.g., 30% growth + 15% margin = 45)
- Low growth + low profit: Concerning (e.g., 15% growth + 10% margin = 25)
