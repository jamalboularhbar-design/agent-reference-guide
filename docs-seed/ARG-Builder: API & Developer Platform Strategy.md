# ARG-Builder: API & Developer Platform Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document defines ARG-Builder's public API and developer platform strategy — the technical architecture, documentation standards, SDK development, partner ecosystem, and developer community building that transform ARG-Builder from a standalone product into an extensible platform. A robust API strategy enables enterprise integrations, partner-built extensions, and a developer ecosystem that compounds product value over time.

## Platform Vision

> **ARG-Builder becomes the operational intelligence layer that any system can read from and write to — making operational knowledge accessible wherever work happens.**

### Platform Maturity Stages

| Stage | Timeline | Capabilities | Revenue Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. Internal API | Months 1–6 | Power own frontend, enable webhooks | Foundation |
| 2. Partner API | Months 6–12 | Select partners build integrations | $200K ARR (partner-sourced) |
| 3. Public API | Months 12–18 | Any developer can build on ARG-Builder | $500K ARR (platform) |
| 4. Marketplace | Months 18–30 | Third-party apps, templates, extensions | $2M ARR (ecosystem) |

## API Architecture

### Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| RESTful + GraphQL | REST for CRUD, GraphQL for complex queries |
| Versioned | URL-based versioning (v1, v2) with 12-month deprecation |
| Rate-limited | Tiered by plan (100/min starter, 1000/min enterprise) |
| Authenticated | OAuth 2.0 + API keys for server-to-server |
| Documented | OpenAPI 3.0 spec, auto-generated reference docs |
| Consistent | Standard error formats, pagination, filtering |

### Core API Endpoints

| Resource | Endpoints | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| /guides | CRUD | Create, read, update, delete operational guides |
| /personas | CRUD | Manage personas within guides |
| /processes | CRUD | Manage process stages and workflows |
| /search | GET | Full-text search across all content |
| /users | CRUD | User management and permissions |
| /teams | CRUD | Team management and assignments |
| /exports | POST | Generate PDF, Markdown, or HTML exports |
| /webhooks | CRUD | Manage webhook subscriptions |
| /analytics | GET | Usage analytics and adoption metrics |
| /ai/generate | POST | AI-powered guide generation |

### API Response Format

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_abc123",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-30T12:00:00Z",
    "version": "v1"
  },
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 25,
    "total": 150,
    "total_pages": 6
  }
}
```

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "The 'name' field is required",
    "details": [
      { "field": "name", "issue": "required" }
    ],
    "request_id": "req_abc123",
    "documentation_url": "https://docs.argbuilder.com/errors/VALIDATION_ERROR"
  }
}
```

## Authentication & Security

| Method | Use Case | Implementation |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code) | User-facing integrations | Standard OAuth flow with PKCE |
| API Keys | Server-to-server, scripts | Scoped keys with rotation |
| JWT Tokens | Session management | Short-lived (1 hour) with refresh |
| Webhook Signatures | Verify webhook authenticity | HMAC-SHA256 signature header |

### Rate Limiting

| Plan | Requests/Minute | Requests/Day | Burst |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Starter | 100 | 10,000 | 200 |
| Professional | 500 | 50,000 | 1,000 |
| Enterprise | 2,000 | 500,000 | 5,000 |
| Partner | 5,000 | 1,000,000 | 10,000 |
