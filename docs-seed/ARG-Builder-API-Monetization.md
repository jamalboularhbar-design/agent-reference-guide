# ARG-Builder: API Monetization Strategy

## Platform Strategy for Developer Ecosystem, API Pricing, and Partner Revenue

---

## 1. Executive Summary

APIs transform a SaaS product from a standalone application into a platform — creating network effects, increasing switching costs, and opening new revenue streams. For ARG-Builder, the API represents a strategic asset that can generate 15–25% of total revenue while dramatically increasing customer stickiness. This document defines the complete API monetization strategy from product design to pricing and go-to-market.

## 3. Pricing Model

### 3.1 Pricing Philosophy

> Price APIs based on the value they create for the customer, not the cost to serve. Usage-based pricing aligns our revenue with customer success — the more value they extract, the more they pay.

### 3.2 Pricing Structure

| Component | Model | Price | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Base access (Core API) | Included | $0 (with subscription) | Drives adoption |
| API calls (Advanced) | Per-call | $0.01–$0.05 per call | Volume discounts |
| AI generation calls | Per-generation | $0.10–$0.50 per generation | Higher value = higher price |
| Data transfer | Per GB | $0.05/GB | Above 10GB/month |
| Webhooks | Per event | $0.001 per event | High volume, low cost |
| Dedicated infrastructure | Monthly | $2,000–$10,000/month | Enterprise only |

### 3.3 Usage Tiers & Volume Discounts

| Monthly API Calls | Price Per Call | Monthly Minimum |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| 0–10,000 | $0.05 | $0 (included) |
| 10,001–100,000 | $0.03 | $300 |
| 100,001–500,000 | $0.02 | $2,000 |
| 500,001–1,000,000 | $0.015 | $7,500 |
| 1,000,001+ | $0.01 | Custom |

### 3.4 AI Generation Pricing

| Generation Type | Price | Value Justification |
|----------------|-------|-------------------|
| Simple content generation | $0.10 | Basic text output |
| Complex document generation | $0.25 | Multi-section, formatted |
| Full operational guide | $0.50 | Complete system generation |
| Custom AI model inference | $0.15 | Trained on customer data |
| Bulk generation (batch) | 50% discount | Efficiency pricing |

### 3.5 Revenue Projections

| Year | API Customers | Avg Monthly Revenue | Annual API Revenue | % of Total Revenue |
|------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Year 1 | 30 | $500 | $180,000 | 8% |
| Year 2 | 100 | $1,200 | $1,440,000 | 15% |
