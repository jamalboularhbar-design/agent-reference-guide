# ARG-Builder: Revenue Forecasting Models

## Multi-Method Framework for Accurate, Board-Ready Revenue Predictions

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Revenue forecasting is the backbone of operational planning — it drives hiring, spending, fundraising, and strategic decisions. Inaccurate forecasts destroy credibility with boards and investors, while overly conservative forecasts leave growth on the table. This document defines ARG-Builder's multi-method forecasting approach, combining bottoms-up pipeline analysis, tops-down market sizing, cohort modeling, and scenario planning to produce reliable, defensible revenue projections.

## 2. Forecasting Methodology Overview

### 2.1 Forecasting Methods

| Method | Best For | Accuracy | Complexity | Time Horizon |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Pipeline-based (bottoms-up) | Near-term (0–3 months) | High (when pipeline is mature) | Medium | 1–3 months |
| Cohort-based | Medium-term (3–12 months) | High (with historical data) | High | 3–18 months |
| Run-rate + growth | Short-term (1–3 months) | Medium | Low | 1–6 months |
| Tops-down (TAM/SAM/SOM) | Long-term (12–36 months) | Low-Medium | Low | 1–5 years |
| Scenario-based | Strategic planning | Ranges, not point estimates | Medium | 6–24 months |
| Hybrid (weighted blend) | Operating forecast | Highest | High | 1–12 months |

### 2.2 Forecast Hierarchy

| Level | Method | Owner | Cadence | Audience |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| Weekly commit | Pipeline-based | AEs + Sales Manager | Weekly | Sales leadership |
| Monthly forecast | Hybrid (pipeline + cohort) | RevOps | Monthly | Leadership team |
| Quarterly board forecast | Hybrid + scenarios | CFO/VP Finance | Quarterly | Board of directors |
| Annual plan | Cohort + tops-down + scenarios | CFO + CEO | Annual | Board + investors |
| Long-range plan (3-year) | Tops-down + cohort trends | CFO | Annual | Board + investors |

## 3. Pipeline-Based Forecasting

### 3.1 Pipeline Stage Conversion Rates

| Stage | Definition | Historical Win Rate | Weighted Probability |
|-------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Prospect | Initial outreach, no meeting | 2% | 2% |
| Discovery | First meeting completed | 8% | 8% |
| Qualified | BANT confirmed, demo scheduled | 20% | 20% |
| Demo/Evaluation | Active evaluation, trial | 35% | 35% |
| Proposal | Proposal sent, pricing discussed | 50% | 50% |
| Negotiation | Contract redlines, legal review | 70% | 70% |
| Verbal commit | Verbal yes, awaiting signature | 90% | 90% |
| Closed Won | Contract signed | 100% | 100% |
| Closed Lost | Deal lost | 0% | 0% |

### 3.2 Pipeline Forecast Calculation

| Component | Formula | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Weighted pipeline | Σ (Deal value × Stage probability) | $500K × 35% = $175K |
| Expected close (month) | Deals × probability × timing adjustment | Adjusted for historical close timing |
| Pipeline coverage ratio | Total pipeline / Quota | Target: 3–4x coverage |
| Commit forecast | Deals at 70%+ probability | High-confidence deals only |
| Best case | Deals at 35%+ probability | Optimistic but achievable |
| Upside | All qualified deals (20%+) | Maximum potential |

### 3.3 Pipeline Adjustments

| Adjustment Factor | Impact | Application |
|------------------|--------|-------------|
| Deal age (stale deals) | -10% per month over average cycle | Reduce probability for aged deals |
| Champion strength | ±15% | Adjust based on champion engagement |
| Competitive presence | -10% to -20% | Known competitive deals |
| Multi-threading | +10% to +15% | Multiple contacts engaged |
| Executive engagement | +10% | C-level involved in evaluation |
| Budget confirmed | +15% | Written budget confirmation |
| Procurement involved | -5% (timing) | Adds time, doesn't reduce probability |

## 9. Common Forecasting Pitfalls

### 9.1 Pitfalls & Solutions

| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Sandbagging | Consistently beating forecast by 20%+ | Calibrate with historical accuracy, incentivize accuracy |
| Happy ears | Consistently missing forecast | Require evidence for stage advancement, deal review |
| Stale pipeline | Large pipeline, low conversion | Enforce pipeline hygiene, age-out rules |
| Single-method reliance | Volatile forecasts | Use multiple methods, weighted blend |
| Ignoring seasonality | Q4 miss, Q1 surprise | Build seasonality into model |
| New rep optimism | New AEs over-forecasting | Apply ramp adjustment factor |
| Expansion assumptions | Over-counting expansion | Base on historical cohort data, not wishes |
| Macro blindness | Market shifts not reflected | Include external indicators |

### 9.2 Forecast Hygiene Rules

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|---------------|
| No deal > 90 days without activity | Auto-move to "stalled" |
| Close date in past | Must update or close-lost |
| Stage advancement requires evidence | Defined criteria per stage |
| Commit = AE stakes reputation | Personal accountability |
| Best case ≠ everything in pipeline | Curated list with rationale |
| Forecast ≠ quota | Forecast is prediction, not target |
