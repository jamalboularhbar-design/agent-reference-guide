# ARG-Builder: OKR Framework & Goal-Setting System

## Objectives and Key Results Operating System for Company-Wide Alignment

---

## 1. Executive Summary

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) provide the goal-setting framework that aligns ARG-Builder's entire organization around shared priorities. When implemented correctly, OKRs create transparency, focus, and accountability — ensuring every team member understands how their work contributes to company success. This document defines the complete OKR operating system including cadence, structure, scoring, and integration with performance management.

## 2. OKR Philosophy

### 2.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Description | Anti-Pattern |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Ambitious | Stretch goals that inspire (70% achievement = success) | Sandbagging easy targets |
| Focused | 3–5 objectives maximum per team | 10+ objectives that dilute focus |
| Measurable | Key results are quantifiable | Vague, subjective measures |
| Time-bound | Quarterly cadence with annual context | Open-ended timelines |
| Transparent | All OKRs visible to entire company | Hidden or siloed goals |
| Decoupled from compensation | OKRs inform but don't determine pay | Direct bonus linkage |
| Bottom-up + top-down | Mix of company-directed and team-proposed | Purely top-down mandates |

### 2.2 OKR Structure

```
OBJECTIVE: Qualitative, inspirational goal (What do we want to achieve?)
├── Key Result 1: Quantitative measure of progress (How do we know we achieved it?)
├── Key Result 2: Quantitative measure of progress
└── Key Result 3: Quantitative measure of progress
```

**Good OKR Example:**
- **Objective:** Become the undisputed leader in AI-powered operational intelligence
  - KR1: Achieve 50 enterprise customers (from 25)
  - KR2: Reach $5M ARR (from $2.2M)
  - KR3: Achieve NPS of 65+ (from 52)

**Bad OKR Example:**
- **Objective:** Improve the product *(too vague)*
  - KR1: Ship more features *(not measurable)*
  - KR2: Make customers happy *(not quantifiable)*
  - KR3: Reduce bugs *(no target)*

## 7. Scoring & Review

### 7.1 Scoring Scale

| Score | Meaning | Color | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|-------|---------------|
| 0.0–0.3 | Failed to make meaningful progress | Red | Significant miss — investigate |
| 0.4–0.6 | Made progress but fell short | Yellow | Partial achievement — learn |
| 0.7–0.9 | Achieved target (stretch goal sweet spot) | Green | Strong performance |
| 1.0 | Fully achieved or exceeded | Blue | Exceptional (or goal wasn't ambitious enough) |

### 7.2 Scoring Guidelines

| Scenario | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| KR target was 100, achieved 70 | 0.7 | On track for stretch goal |
| KR target was 100, achieved 40 | 0.4 | Significant miss |
| KR target was 100, achieved 100 | 1.0 | Consider if goal was ambitious enough |
| KR target was 100, achieved 120 | 1.0 (cap) | Exceeded — great, but was it a stretch? |
| KR was binary (ship/don't ship), shipped | 1.0 | Binary KRs are 0 or 1 |
| KR was binary, didn't ship | 0.0 | Binary miss |

### 7.3 Quarterly Review Process

| Step | Activity | Duration | Output |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Self-score all KRs | 30 min | Scored OKRs |
| 2 | Team review (discuss scores, learnings) | 60 min | Team retrospective |
| 3 | Cross-functional alignment check | 30 min | Dependency review |
| 4 | Leadership review | 60 min | Company scorecard |
| 5 | Retrospective (what worked, what didn't) | 30 min | Process improvements |
| 6 | Publish results (transparent) | — | Company-wide visibility |

### 7.4 Confidence Scoring (Mid-Quarter)

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| On track | Likely to achieve 0.7+ | Continue execution |
| At risk | May fall below 0.7 | Identify blockers, adjust approach |
| Off track | Unlikely to achieve 0.4+ | Escalate, reprioritize, or adjust KR |

## 8. OKR Anti-Patterns

### 8.1 Common Mistakes

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Too many OKRs | Dilutes focus, nothing gets done | Maximum 3–5 objectives |
| Sandbagging | Goals too easy, no stretch | Score history should average 0.7 |
| Task-based KRs | "Launch feature X" isn't a result | Focus on outcomes, not outputs |
| No alignment | Team OKRs disconnected from company | Cascade from company OKRs |
| Set and forget | OKRs written then ignored | Weekly check-ins required |
| Punishing misses | People sandbag to avoid failure | Celebrate learning from ambitious misses |
| Changing OKRs mid-quarter | Destroys focus and accountability | Only change if strategy fundamentally shifts |
| Individual OKRs = job description | OKRs should be stretch, not BAU | Separate OKRs from role expectations |

### 8.2 OKR vs. KPI Distinction

| Dimension | OKR | KPI |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Purpose | Drive change and improvement | Monitor ongoing health |
| Nature | Aspirational, stretch | Operational, steady-state |
| Timeframe | Quarterly (time-bound) | Ongoing (continuous) |
| Achievement | 70% = success | 100% = expected |
| Example | "Increase NPS from 52 to 65" | "Maintain uptime > 99.9%" |
| Consequence of miss | Learning opportunity | Operational concern |
