# ARG-Builder: Churn Prevention System

## Executive Summary

This document defines ARG-Builder's comprehensive churn prevention system — a proactive, data-driven framework for identifying at-risk accounts before they churn and executing targeted interventions to save them. For a SaaS business with $2K–$10K/month contracts, losing a single customer costs $24K–$120K in ARR. The system combines health scoring, early warning indicators, automated alerts, intervention playbooks, and save strategies to maintain net revenue retention above 120%.

## Customer Health Score Model

The health score is a composite metric (0–100) that predicts the likelihood of renewal. Scores are calculated daily and visible on the customer success dashboard.

### Health Score Components

| Component | Weight | Data Source | Scoring Logic |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Product Usage | 30% | Platform analytics | DAU/MAU ratio, feature breadth, session duration |
| Adoption Depth | 25% | Platform analytics | % of team active, search usage, command palette usage |
| Engagement | 20% | CRM + Support | CSM meeting attendance, email responsiveness, NPS |
| Support Sentiment | 15% | Support tickets | Ticket volume, resolution satisfaction, escalations |
| Contract Signals | 10% | CRM | Payment history, contract discussions, expansion signals |

### Health Score Ranges

| Score | Status | Color | Action |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 80–100 | Healthy | Green | Monitor, identify expansion opportunities |
| 60–79 | Neutral | Yellow | Proactive outreach, engagement boost |
| 40–59 | At Risk | Orange | Intervention required within 7 days |
| 0–39 | Critical | Red | Emergency save protocol within 48 hours |
