# ARG-Builder: Customer Migration & Implementation Playbook

## Seamless Transition from Legacy Systems to ARG-Builder

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This playbook provides a structured methodology for migrating customers from their existing operational documentation systems (Notion, Confluence, SharePoint, Google Docs, paper-based processes) to ARG-Builder. A successful migration minimizes disruption, preserves institutional knowledge, and delivers immediate value — converting skeptics into champions.

---

## 2. Migration Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Zero knowledge loss** — Every piece of existing documentation is accounted for
2. **Minimal disruption** — Teams continue working during migration
3. **Immediate value** — Users see improvement from Day 1, not Day 90
4. **Phased approach** — Migrate in waves, not all at once
5. **Rollback safety** — Original systems remain accessible during transition

---

## 3. Pre-Migration Assessment

### 3.1 Current State Audit

**Discovery Questions:**
- What systems currently hold operational documentation?
- How many documents/pages exist across all systems?
- Who are the primary content creators and consumers?
- What's the current search/findability experience?
- What are the biggest pain points with the current system?
- Are there compliance or retention requirements?
- What integrations exist with other tools?

### 3.2 Migration Complexity Scoring

| Factor | Low (1) | Medium (3) | High (5) | Weight |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Document volume | < 500 pages | 500–5,000 | > 5,000 | 20% |
| System count | 1 system | 2–3 systems | 4+ systems | 15% |
| Custom integrations | None | 1–3 | 4+ | 15% |
| Content structure | Well-organized | Partially | Chaotic | 20% |
| Team size | < 20 | 20–100 | 100+ | 15% |
| Compliance needs | None | Standard | Regulated | 15% |

**Complexity Tiers:**
- Score 1.0–2.0: **Simple** (2–4 weeks)
- Score 2.1–3.5: **Moderate** (4–8 weeks)
- Score 3.6–5.0: **Complex** (8–16 weeks)

### 3.3 Content Inventory

| Category | Source System | Page Count | Owner | Priority | Migration Method |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| SOPs | Confluence | 150 | Ops | P1 | Automated + review |
| Playbooks | Google Docs | 45 | Sales | P1 | Manual restructure |
| Policies | SharePoint | 80 | Legal | P2 | Automated + review |
| Meeting notes | Notion | 500+ | All | P3 | Selective import |
| Training | LMS | 30 | HR | P2 | Rebuild in ARG |

| 1 | Core SOPs, playbooks | Operations, Sales | 1 week | 95% accuracy, team sign-off |
| 2 | Department docs | All departments | 2 weeks | 90% accuracy, usage metrics |
| 3 | Archives, reference | All | 1 week | Completeness verified |

### Phase 5: Optimize (Weeks 9–12)

**Activities:**
- Monitor adoption and usage metrics
- Gather user feedback
- Fix content gaps and quality issues
- Optimize search and navigation
- Decommission legacy systems
- Conduct post-migration review

**Deliverables:**
- Adoption dashboard
- User feedback summary
- Optimization recommendations
- Legacy system decommission plan

## 5. Technical Migration Approaches

### 5.1 Migration Methods by Source

| Source System | Method | Tool | Accuracy | Effort |
|-------------|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Confluence | API export + transform | Custom script | 90% | Medium |
| Notion | API export + restructure | Notion API | 85% | Medium |
| Google Docs | Drive API + conversion | Google API | 80% | Medium |
| SharePoint | Graph API + mapping | MS Graph | 75% | High |
| Word/PDF files | OCR + AI structuring | Custom pipeline | 70% | High |
| Paper-based | Scanning + AI extraction | Document AI | 60% | Very High |

### 5.2 Content Transformation Rules

**Structure Mapping:**
```
Source (Confluence)          →    Target (ARG-Builder)
─────────────────                ────────────────────
Space                       →    Domain
Page tree                   →    Category hierarchy
Page                        →    Knowledge article
Attachment                  →    Embedded asset
Comment                     →    Revision note
Label                       →    Tag
```

**Content Enhancement During Migration:**
1. Add metadata (owner, review date, audience)
2. Apply consistent formatting and templates
3. Update stale content (flag for review)
4. Add cross-references and related links
5. Generate summaries for long documents
6. Tag with taxonomy categories

### 5.3 Data Validation Checklist

- [ ] All pages accounted for (source count = target count)
- [ ] Formatting preserved (headings, lists, tables)
- [ ] Images and attachments transferred
- [ ] Links updated to new locations
- [ ] Permissions mapped correctly
- [ ] Metadata populated
- [ ] Search indexing complete
- [ ] No broken references
