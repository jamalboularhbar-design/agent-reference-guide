# ARG-Builder: Customer Data Platform Architecture

## Unified Customer Intelligence for Personalization, Retention, and Growth

---

## 1. Executive Summary

A Customer Data Platform (CDP) unifies all customer data — behavioral, transactional, and demographic — into a single, actionable view. For ARG-Builder, the CDP powers personalized experiences, predictive churn models, expansion triggers, and data-driven decision-making across every customer-facing team. This document defines the architecture, data model, integrations, and use cases.
