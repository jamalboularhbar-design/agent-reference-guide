# ARG-Builder: Revenue Operations Automation

## End-to-End Automation of the Revenue Engine from Lead to Renewal

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Revenue Operations (RevOps) automation eliminates manual handoffs, reduces data entry, accelerates pipeline velocity, and ensures no revenue opportunity falls through the cracks. For ARG-Builder, automating the revenue engine is critical to scaling from $2M to $25M ARR without proportionally scaling headcount. This playbook defines every automation across the lead-to-cash lifecycle.
