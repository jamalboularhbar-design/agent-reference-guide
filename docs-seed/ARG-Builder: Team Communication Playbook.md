## Executive Summary

This document defines ARG-Builder's internal communication system — the cadences, channels, templates, and protocols that keep a fast-growing team aligned, informed, and productive. Effective communication is the operating system of a startup; this playbook ensures information flows efficiently without creating noise or meeting fatigue.

## Communication Principles

| Principle | Definition | Application |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Async-first** | Default to written, async communication | Use Slack/docs before scheduling meetings |
| **Transparency** | Share context broadly, restrict access rarely | Open channels, shared docs, public decisions |
| **Brevity** | Respect attention; be concise | BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) in all comms |
| **Intentionality** | Every communication has a clear purpose | State: inform, discuss, or decide |
| **Documentation** | Decisions and context are recorded | Meeting notes, decision logs, ADRs |

---

## Communication Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Response SLA | Examples |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Slack (async)** | Day-to-day coordination, quick questions | 4 hours (business hours) | Updates, questions, FYIs |
| **Slack (urgent)** | Time-sensitive issues requiring immediate attention | 15 minutes | Production incidents, customer escalations |
| **Email** | External communication, formal internal comms | 24 hours | Customer comms, legal, board updates |
| **Notion/Docs** | Long-form thinking, proposals, documentation | 48 hours (for review requests) | RFCs, specs, meeting notes |
| **Video call** | Complex discussions, relationship building | Scheduled | 1:1s, brainstorms, all-hands |
| **Loom** | Async video updates, demos, walkthroughs | N/A (one-way) | Feature demos, context sharing |

| All meetings have a designated note-taker | Captures decisions for absent team members |
| Meetings end with clear action items + owners | Drives accountability |
| 25-minute or 50-minute meetings (not 30/60) | Buffer time between meetings |
| Camera-on for < 8 people, optional for larger | Builds connection without fatigue |
| No-meeting Wednesday afternoons | Protected deep work time |
| Record all-hands and leadership syncs | Async access for different time zones |

| Record decisions | Document outcomes in shared docs, not just Slack |
| Time-zone awareness | Don't expect immediate responses outside core hours |
