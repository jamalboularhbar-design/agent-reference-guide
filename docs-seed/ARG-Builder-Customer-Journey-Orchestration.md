# ARG-Builder: Customer Journey Orchestration

## End-to-End Framework for Designing, Automating, and Optimizing Every Customer Touchpoint

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Customer journey orchestration moves beyond static lifecycle emails to dynamic, multi-channel experiences that adapt in real-time based on customer behavior, context, and intent. Rather than treating customers as segments in a funnel, orchestration treats each customer as an individual on a unique path — triggering the right message, through the right channel, at the right moment. This document defines ARG-Builder's complete journey orchestration strategy from awareness through advocacy.

## 2. Journey Architecture

### 2.1 Journey Stages

| Stage | Customer State | Primary Goal | Success Metric |
|-------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Awareness | Knows the problem, discovering solutions | Educate, build trust | Website visits, content engagement |
| Consideration | Evaluating ARG-Builder vs. alternatives | Demonstrate value, differentiate | Trial signups, demo requests |
| Activation | New customer, first experiences | Achieve first value quickly | Time to first value, activation rate |
| Adoption | Using product, building habits | Deepen engagement, expand usage | Feature adoption, DAU/WAU |
| Expansion | Ready for more value | Increase ACV, add seats/features | Expansion revenue, NRR |
| Renewal | Approaching contract end | Secure renewal, prevent churn | Renewal rate, GRR |
| Advocacy | Highly satisfied, willing to promote | Generate referrals, testimonials | NPS, referrals, reviews |

### 2.2 Journey Orchestration Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Behavior-triggered, not time-based | Actions trigger next touchpoint, not arbitrary delays |
| Channel-appropriate | Use the channel that fits the message and moment |
| Contextually relevant | Content reflects what customer just did or needs |
| Respectful frequency | Never overwhelm; quality over quantity |
| Measurably effective | Every touchpoint has a measurable outcome |
| Continuously optimized | A/B test, measure, iterate |
| Human + automated | Automation handles scale, humans handle complexity |
