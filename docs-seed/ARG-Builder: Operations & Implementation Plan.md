# ARG-Builder: Operations & Implementation Plan

## Operations Overview

ARG-Builder's operations are designed to support rapid scaling while maintaining quality, security, and customer satisfaction. The operations strategy emphasizes automation, outsourcing non-core functions, and building scalable processes.

## Infrastructure & Technology

### Cloud Infrastructure

ARG-Builder operates on Amazon Web Services (AWS) providing scalability, reliability, and security. The infrastructure architecture includes auto-scaling application servers, managed databases, content delivery networks, and backup systems.

**Architecture Components:**

The frontend is deployed on AWS CloudFront for global content delivery with sub-second latency. The backend runs on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with auto-scaling based on demand. The database uses Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas for scalability and automated backups. Search functionality uses Amazon Elasticsearch for fast, scalable search across all guide content. Caching uses Amazon ElastiCache with Redis for improved performance. File storage uses Amazon S3 for guides, PDFs, and user-generated content. Monitoring uses Amazon CloudWatch with automated alerting for performance issues.

**Infrastructure Costs:**

Year 1 infrastructure costs are approximately $96,000 annually, scaling to $500,000+ by Year 5 as customer base and usage grow. Infrastructure costs are optimized through reserved instances, spot instances, and auto-scaling to match demand.

### Security & Compliance

ARG-Builder implements enterprise-grade security protecting customer data and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Security Measures:**

Encryption at rest uses AES-256 encryption for all data stored in databases and file storage. Encryption in transit uses TLS 1.2+ for all data transmitted between clients and servers. Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 and SAML for enterprise single sign-on. Authorization uses role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions. Audit logging tracks all user actions and data access for compliance and security analysis. Vulnerability scanning uses automated tools to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities. Penetration testing is conducted quarterly by third-party security firms. Security training is provided to all employees.

**Compliance Certifications:**

SOC 2 Type II certification demonstrates compliance with security, availability, and confidentiality standards. HIPAA compliance enables serving healthcare customers. GDPR compliance ensures protection of European customer data. CCPA compliance ensures protection of California resident data. ISO 27001 certification demonstrates information security management system compliance.

### Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

ARG-Builder implements comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity procedures ensuring minimal downtime and data loss.

**Disaster Recovery:**

Automated backups occur every hour with retention of 30 days. Backup replication across multiple AWS regions ensures data availability even if a region fails. Recovery time objective (RTO) is 1 hour for critical systems. Recovery point objective (RPO) is 1 hour for data. Disaster recovery testing occurs quarterly to ensure procedures work effectively.

**Business Continuity:**

Redundant systems across multiple availability zones ensure high availability. Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers. Automated failover switches to backup systems if primary systems fail. Uptime target is 99.9% with monthly maintenance windows. Status page provides real-time system status to customers.

## Product Development

### Development Process

ARG-Builder follows an agile development process with two-week sprints, daily standups, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

**Development Workflow:**

Product managers define requirements and prioritize features based on customer feedback and business priorities. Engineers implement features using test-driven development with comprehensive unit and integration tests. Code reviews ensure quality and knowledge sharing. Continuous integration automatically runs tests and deploys to staging environment. Manual testing on staging environment validates functionality and user experience. Deployment to production occurs after successful testing and approval.

**Development Tools:**

GitHub provides version control and code repository. GitHub Actions provides continuous integration and deployment automation. Docker provides containerization for consistent deployment across environments. Jest and React Testing Library provide testing frameworks. Figma provides design collaboration. Jira provides project management and issue tracking.
