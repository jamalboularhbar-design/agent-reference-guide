# ARG-Builder: Vendor Management Framework

## Procurement, Evaluation, and Ongoing Management of Third-Party Vendors and Tools

---

## 1. Executive Summary

As ARG-Builder scales, the number of vendors, tools, and third-party services grows exponentially. Without structured vendor management, companies face security risks, budget overruns, redundant tools, and compliance gaps. This framework defines the complete vendor lifecycle — from evaluation and procurement to ongoing management and renewal decisions.
