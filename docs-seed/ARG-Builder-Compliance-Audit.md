# ARG-Builder: Compliance & Audit Readiness Guide

## Framework for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and Enterprise Security Compliance

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Enterprise customers require vendors to demonstrate security and compliance maturity through certifications and audits. SOC 2 Type II is the minimum bar for selling to mid-market and enterprise companies, while ISO 27001 opens international markets. This guide defines ARG-Builder's compliance roadmap, control framework, audit preparation process, and ongoing compliance operations.
