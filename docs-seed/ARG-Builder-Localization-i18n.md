# ARG-Builder: Product Localization & Internationalization (i18n) Strategy

## Comprehensive Framework for Multi-Language, Multi-Region Product Expansion

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Internationalization (i18n) is the architectural foundation that enables localization (l10n) — the process of adapting ARG-Builder for specific locales, languages, and cultural contexts. With English-speaking markets representing only 25% of global SaaS TAM, localization unlocks massive growth potential. This document defines the complete i18n/l10n strategy from technical architecture through translation workflows to regional go-to-market execution.
