# ARG-Builder: Scalability & Infrastructure Planning

## Executive Summary

This document defines ARG-Builder's infrastructure scaling strategy — the architecture decisions, capacity planning models, and operational procedures that ensure the platform performs reliably as customer count grows from 10 to 10,000+ organizations. Every architectural choice is made with a 10x growth horizon in mind.

## Capacity Planning

### Resource Scaling Rules

| Resource | Metric | Scale-Up Trigger | Scale-Down Trigger | Cooldown |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| App servers | CPU utilization | > 70% for 3 min | < 30% for 10 min | 5 min |
| App servers | Request latency (p99) | > 500ms for 2 min | N/A | 5 min |
| Database | Connection count | > 80% max | N/A (manual) | N/A |
| Database | CPU | > 75% for 5 min | N/A (manual) | N/A |
| Cache | Memory utilization | > 75% | N/A (manual) | N/A |
| Search | Query latency (p95) | > 200ms for 5 min | < 50ms for 30 min | 10 min |
| AI workers | Queue depth | > 100 messages | < 10 messages | 3 min |

### Load Testing Targets

| Scenario | Target | Acceptable | Degraded | Critical |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Homepage load | < 1s | < 2s | 2–5s | > 5s |
| Search query | < 200ms | < 500ms | 500ms–1s | > 1s |
| Guide generation (AI) | < 30s | < 60s | 60–120s | > 120s |
| API response (p95) | < 100ms | < 250ms | 250–500ms | > 500ms |
| Concurrent users | 1,000 | 500–1,000 | 200–500 | < 200 |
| Throughput | 5,000 req/s | 2,000–5,000 | 500–2,000 | < 500 |

| High (core app, API) | < 15 min | < 1 min | Multi-AZ with failover |
| Medium (search, analytics) | < 1 hour | < 15 min | Automated restore |
| Low (batch jobs, reports) | < 4 hours | < 1 hour | Manual restore |

### Backup Strategy

| Data | Method | Frequency | Retention | Location |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Database | Automated snapshots | Every 5 min (PITR) | 35 days | Cross-region |
| File storage (S3) | Versioning + replication | Real-time | 90 days | Cross-region |
| Configuration | Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) | On every change | Unlimited (Git) | GitHub |
| Secrets | AWS Secrets Manager | On change | Version history | Multi-region |

| Spot Instances (non-critical) | 60–90% | Medium | Batch processing, dev/test |
| Right-sizing | 20–40% | Medium | Quarterly review |
| Auto-scaling (scale-down) | 30–50% | Medium | Off-peak hours |
| Caching (reduce compute) | 20–60% | Medium | Repeated queries, AI responses |
| S3 Intelligent Tiering | 20–40% | Low | > 100GB storage |
| CDN caching | 30–50% | Low | Static assets, API responses |

|------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Starter | 99.5% | 24h (business hours) | None |
| Professional | 99.9% | 4h (business hours) | 5% per 0.1% below |
| Enterprise | 99.95% | 1h (24/7) | 10% per 0.05% below |
| Strategic | 99.99% | 15 min (24/7) | 25% per 0.01% below |
