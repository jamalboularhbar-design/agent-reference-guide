# ARG-Builder: Revenue Recognition & Financial Reporting

## Executive Summary

Proper revenue recognition is critical for fundraising, M&A readiness, and operational decision-making.

## ASC 606 Five-Step Model Application

### Step 1: Identify the Contract

| Contract Type | Recognition Trigger | Documentation Required |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Click-through (self-serve) | Electronic acceptance | ToS acceptance log |
| Signed order form | Mutual signature | Executed order form |
| Enterprise MSA + Order Form | Both executed | MSA + Order Form |
| SOW (professional services) | Signed SOW | Executed SOW |
| Renewal (auto) | Renewal date | Auto-renewal confirmation |

### Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations

| Obligation | Nature | Standalone? | Typical Allocation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| SaaS platform access | Stand-ready obligation | Yes | 75–85% of total contract value |
| Implementation services | Distinct service | Yes (if customer could self-implement) | 10–15% |
| Training | Distinct service | Yes | 3–5% |
| Premium support | Stand-ready obligation | Yes | 5–10% |
| Custom development | Distinct deliverable | Depends on specificity | Case-by-case |

### Step 3: Determine Transaction Price

| Component | Treatment | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Fixed subscription fee | Include in full | $5,000/month |
| Variable usage fees | Estimate (most likely amount) | AI credits overage |
| Discounts | Allocate proportionally | 20% annual discount |
| Payment terms (> 12 months) | No significant financing component | Net 30 standard |
| Non-cash consideration | Fair value at contract inception | Equity swap (rare) |

### Step 4: Allocate Transaction Price

| Method | When Used | Application |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Adjusted market assessment | Primary method | Based on what market would pay |
| Expected cost plus margin | When market data unavailable | Cost of delivery + target margin |
| Residual approach | Highly variable pricing | Rarely used |

### Step 5: Recognize Revenue

| Obligation Type | Recognition Pattern | Basis |
|----------------|--------------------|----|
| SaaS subscription | Ratably over contract term | Time-based (daily proration) |
| Implementation | Over implementation period or at completion | Milestone-based or time-based |
| Training | Upon delivery | Point-in-time |
| Professional services (time-based) | As services are performed | Input method (hours) |
| Custom development | Over development period | Output method (milestones) |
