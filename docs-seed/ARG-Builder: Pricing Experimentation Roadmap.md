# ARG-Builder: Pricing Experimentation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document defines ARG-Builder's 12-month pricing experimentation strategy — the systematic approach to optimizing pricing for maximum revenue, conversion, and customer satisfaction. Pricing is the single highest-leverage growth lever; a 1% improvement in pricing yields 11% improvement in profit, compared to 3.3% for volume and 7.8% for cost reduction.

## Experimentation Philosophy

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data over intuition** | Every pricing change is validated with evidence before full rollout |
| **Incremental changes** | Small, measurable adjustments rather than dramatic overhauls |
| **Segment-specific** | Different segments may warrant different pricing approaches |
| **Value-aligned** | Price reflects value delivered, not cost incurred |
| **Reversible** | All experiments are designed to be rolled back if negative |

## Experiment Design Framework

### Pre-Experiment Checklist

| Step | Action | Owner | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Define hypothesis clearly | PM | Day 1 |
| 2 | Identify primary + secondary metrics | PM + Data | Day 1–2 |
| 3 | Calculate required sample size | Data Analyst | Day 2 |
| 4 | Define success criteria (MDE) | PM + Finance | Day 2 |
| 5 | Document potential risks | PM + CS | Day 3 |
| 6 | Get legal/finance approval | PM | Day 3–5 |
| 7 | Build experiment (engineering) | Eng | Day 5–10 |
| 8 | QA and launch | PM + QA | Day 10–12 |
| 9 | Monitor daily for first week | Data + PM | Week 1 |
| 10 | Analyze results at significance | Data | End of experiment |

### Statistical Requirements

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Confidence level | 95% (p < 0.05) |
| Statistical power | 80% minimum |
| Minimum detectable effect (MDE) | 10% relative change |
| Minimum sample size | Calculated per experiment (typically 500–2,000 per variant) |
| Minimum duration | 2 full business weeks (account for weekly patterns) |
| Maximum duration | 8 weeks (avoid novelty effects) |

## Pricing Page Optimization

### Elements to Test

| Element | Variants to Test | Expected Impact |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Number of tiers displayed | 3 vs. 4 | Plan distribution |
| Recommended/highlighted tier | Middle vs. highest | ARPU |
| Price display (monthly vs. annual) | Show monthly vs. show annual with savings | Annual plan selection |
| Feature comparison table | Collapsed vs. expanded | Page engagement |
| CTA copy | "Start free trial" vs. "Get started" vs. "Try free" | Click-through rate |
| Social proof placement | Above pricing vs. below vs. both | Trust, conversion |
| FAQ section | Present vs. absent | Support tickets, conversion |
| Money-back guarantee | Present vs. absent | Conversion, refund rate |
| Enterprise CTA | "Contact sales" vs. "Get a quote" vs. "Book demo" | Enterprise leads |

## Risk Management

### Pricing Change Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Existing customer backlash | Medium | High | Grandfather existing customers, communicate value |
| Conversion rate drop | Medium | High | Small cohort tests before full rollout, rollback plan |
| Competitive response | Low | Medium | Monitor competitors, maintain value differentiation |
| Internal confusion | Medium | Low | Clear documentation, sales enablement |
| Legal/compliance issues | Low | High | Legal review before launch, clear terms |

### Rollback Protocol

| Trigger | Action | Timeline | Owner |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Conversion drops > 20% for 5+ days | Pause experiment, investigate | Same day | PM + Data |
| Customer complaints > 10 in 48 hours | Review and potentially rollback | 24 hours | PM + CS |
| Revenue impact > -15% projected | Immediate rollback | Same day | PM + Finance |
| Legal/compliance concern raised | Pause immediately, review | Immediate | Legal + PM |
