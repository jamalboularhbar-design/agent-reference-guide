# ARG-Builder: Security & Incident Response Plan

## Executive Summary

This document defines ARG-Builder's comprehensive security posture and incident response procedures. As a B2B SaaS platform handling sensitive operational data for mid-market and enterprise customers, security is not merely a compliance requirement — it is a competitive advantage and a trust foundation. This plan covers security policies, access controls, data protection, vulnerability management, incident classification, response procedures, communication protocols, and post-incident review processes.

## Security Framework

### Security Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Defense in depth | Multiple layers of security controls |
| Least privilege | Minimum access required for each role |
| Zero trust | Verify every request, trust no network |
| Shift left | Security integrated into development lifecycle |
| Assume breach | Design systems assuming attackers are already inside |

### Security Governance

| Role | Responsibility | Person |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Security Lead | Overall security strategy, policy, compliance | CTO (initially) |
| Incident Commander | Leads incident response during active incidents | Rotating (engineering) |
| Data Protection Officer | GDPR/privacy compliance, data handling | VP Engineering |
| Security Champions | Per-team security advocates, code review | 1 per engineering team |

---

## Access Control

### Identity & Access Management

| Control | Implementation | Standard |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Authentication | SSO via Google Workspace + MFA required | All employees |
| Authorization | Role-based access control (RBAC) | Principle of least privilege |
| Password policy | 16+ characters, no reuse, password manager required | 1Password Teams |
| MFA | Hardware keys (YubiKey) for production access | Required for all |
| Session management | 8-hour session timeout, re-auth for sensitive actions | All systems |
| Service accounts | Unique per service, rotated quarterly | Automated rotation |

### Access Levels

| Level | Access | Who | Approval |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| L1 (Read) | View dashboards, logs, documentation | All employees | Automatic |
| L2 (Write) | Modify code, configuration, non-production data | Engineers | Manager approval |
| L3 (Admin) | Production database, infrastructure, secrets | Senior engineers | CTO approval |
| L4 (Super Admin) | Billing, customer data, security systems | CTO + CEO only | Board awareness |

### Production Access

| Policy | Standard |
|--------|----------|
| Direct database access | Prohibited (use admin tools with audit logging) |
| SSH to production | Emergency only, requires justification + approval |
| Customer data access | Requires written justification, time-limited, fully audited |
| Secret management | HashiCorp Vault, no secrets in code or environment variables |
| Infrastructure changes | Terraform only (no manual changes), PR-reviewed |

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

| Classification | Description | Examples | Controls |
|----------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Public | Freely available | Marketing content, pricing | None required |
| Internal | Company-only information | Internal docs, metrics | Access control |
| Confidential | Sensitive business data | Customer data, financials | Encryption + access control |
| Restricted | Highest sensitivity | Credentials, PII, health data | Encryption + strict access + audit |

### Encryption Standards

| Data State | Standard | Implementation |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| At rest | AES-256 | AWS KMS-managed keys, database encryption |
| In transit | TLS 1.3 | All connections, no exceptions |
| In use | Application-level | Sensitive fields encrypted in memory |
| Backups | AES-256 | Encrypted before storage, separate key |
| Key management | AWS KMS | Automatic rotation every 90 days |

### Data Retention & Disposal

| Data Type | Retention Period | Disposal Method |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Customer operational data | Duration of contract + 30 days | Secure deletion + verification |
| Customer PII | Duration of contract + 30 days | Secure deletion + certificate |
| Application logs | 90 days (hot), 1 year (cold) | Automatic expiration |
| Security logs | 2 years | Archived, then secure deletion |
| Financial records | 7 years | Archived per legal requirements |
| Employee data | Employment + 3 years | Secure deletion |

## Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Scanning

| Type | Tool | Frequency | Scope |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| Dependency scanning | Snyk | Every PR + daily | All dependencies |
| Static analysis | CodeQL + SonarQube | Every PR | All application code |
| Container scanning | Trivy | Every build | All Docker images |
| Infrastructure scanning | AWS Inspector | Weekly | All cloud resources |
| Penetration testing | External firm | Annually | Full application + infrastructure |
| Bug bounty | HackerOne (private) | Continuous | Public-facing application |

### Vulnerability Response SLAs

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time | Remediation Time |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 9.0–10.0 | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | 24 hours | 7 days |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | 72 hours | 30 days |
| Low | 0.1–3.9 | 1 week | 90 days |

## Incident Classification

### Incident Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Examples | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|
| SEV-1 (Critical) | Active data breach, service completely down, security compromise | Data exfiltration, ransomware, total outage | All-hands, CEO notified, customer notification |
| SEV-2 (Major) | Partial service degradation, potential data exposure, failed security control | Partial outage, unauthorized access attempt, failed encryption | On-call team + security lead, management notified |
| SEV-3 (Moderate) | Minor service impact, security policy violation, suspicious activity | Single feature down, policy violation, unusual login | On-call engineer, documented and tracked |
| SEV-4 (Low) | No immediate impact, potential future risk | Unpatched non-critical system, minor misconfiguration | Scheduled remediation, backlog item |

---

## Incident Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage (0–15 minutes)

| Step | Action | Owner | Tool |
|------|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | Alert received (automated or reported) | On-call engineer | PagerDuty |

| 4 | Verify eradication (scan, test, validate) | Security lead |
| 5 | Document actions taken | IC |

### Phase 4: Recovery (4–24 hours)
