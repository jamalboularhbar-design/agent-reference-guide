# ARG-Builder: Developer Relations (DevRel) Strategy

## Framework for Building Developer Community, API Ecosystem, and Technical Advocacy

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Developer Relations (DevRel) bridges the gap between ARG-Builder's platform capabilities and the developer community that builds on, integrates with, and extends the product. As ARG-Builder evolves from a standalone tool to a platform with APIs and integrations, DevRel becomes a strategic growth lever — driving adoption through technical content, community building, and developer experience excellence. This document defines the complete DevRel strategy.
