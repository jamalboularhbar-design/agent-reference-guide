# ARG-Builder: Engineering Hiring Technical Assessments

## Structured Framework for Evaluating Technical Talent with Rigor and Fairness

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Technical assessments determine whether engineering candidates can perform the actual work required. Poorly designed assessments waste candidate time, introduce bias, and miss great talent. Well-designed assessments predict job performance, respect candidate time, and create a positive experience regardless of outcome. This document defines ARG-Builder's complete technical assessment system across all engineering roles.

## 2. Assessment Philosophy

### 2.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation | Anti-Pattern |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Job relevance | Assess skills used daily in the role | Whiteboard algorithms unrelated to work |
| Time respect | < 4 hours total candidate investment | 8-hour take-homes, 6-round interviews |
| Bias reduction | Structured rubrics, diverse panels | Gut feel, culture fit as proxy |
| Candidate experience | Clear expectations, timely feedback | Ghosting, unclear process |
| Signal quality | Multiple data points, calibrated scoring | Single interviewer veto |
| Transparency | Share evaluation criteria upfront | Secret scoring, trick questions |
| Two-way evaluation | Candidates assess us too | One-sided interrogation |

### 2.2 Assessment Pipeline

| Stage | Duration | Purpose | Pass Rate |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Resume screen | 5 min | Basic qualification check | 20–30% |
| Recruiter call | 30 min | Mutual fit, logistics, expectations | 70% |
| Technical screen | 45–60 min | Core technical competency | 40–50% |
| Take-home OR live coding | 2–3 hours | Practical problem-solving | 50–60% |
| System design (senior+) | 60 min | Architecture and trade-off thinking | 50% |
| Team/culture fit | 45 min | Collaboration, values alignment | 80% |
| Hiring committee | 30 min | Final decision, calibration | 60–70% |

## 4. Take-Home vs. Live Coding

### 4.1 Comparison

| Factor | Take-Home | Live Coding |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Time pressure | Low (own pace) | High (real-time) |
| Environment | Candidate's own setup | Unfamiliar environment |
| Anxiety impact | Lower | Higher |
| Cheating risk | Higher | Lower |
| Signal quality | Higher (more natural work) | Lower (artificial pressure) |
| Scheduling | Flexible | Requires coordination |
| Candidate preference | Generally preferred | Some prefer (faster process) |
| Bias | Lower (anonymous review possible) | Higher (appearance, communication style) |

### 4.2 ARG-Builder Approach

| Role Level | Recommended Format | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Junior (0–2 years) | Live coding (pair programming) | Mentoring signal, less intimidating with support |
| Mid (3–5 years) | Candidate choice (take-home OR live) | Respect preference, both valid |
| Senior (5+ years) | Take-home + system design discussion | Deeper signal, respects experience |
| Staff+ (8+ years) | Architecture discussion + code review | No coding exercise needed |

### 4.3 Take-Home Guidelines

| Guideline | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Time limit | Maximum 3 hours (stated clearly) |
| Deadline | 5–7 days to complete (flexible) |
| Scope | Well-defined, achievable in time limit |
| Evaluation | Blind review (name removed) |
| Compensation | $200 gift card for completed submissions |
| Feedback | Written feedback regardless of outcome |
| Reuse | Never reuse candidate's work |

## 5. Scoring & Calibration

### 5.1 Scoring Framework

| Score | Definition | Hiring Signal |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 — Strong No | Significant gaps, would struggle in role | Do not hire |
| 2 — Lean No | Some gaps, concerns about performance | Do not hire (unless other signals very strong) |
| 3 — Lean Yes | Meets bar, some areas to develop | Hire (with development plan) |
| 4 — Strong Yes | Exceeds bar, would thrive immediately | Definitely hire |

### 5.2 Evaluation Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What to Assess |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Technical skills | 35% | Can they do the technical work? |
| Problem-solving | 25% | How do they approach ambiguity? |
| Communication | 15% | Can they explain their thinking? |
| Collaboration | 15% | How do they work with others? |
| Growth potential | 10% | Will they grow in the role? |

### 5.3 Calibration Process

| Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Interviewer training | Before first interview | Consistent evaluation standards |
| Shadow interviews | First 3 interviews | Learn from experienced interviewers |
| Calibration sessions | Monthly | Align scoring across interviewers |
| Scorecard review | Quarterly | Identify scoring drift |

| Anchoring | Write feedback before discussing with others |
| Confirmation bias | Standardized rubrics, blind code review |
| Recency bias | Take notes during interview, score immediately |
| Attribution bias | Focus on demonstrated behavior, not assumptions |

### 6.2 Process Safeguards

| Safeguard | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Structured interviews | Same questions for all candidates at same level |
| Blind resume review | Remove name, photo, school for initial screen |
| Blind code review | Remove identifying information from take-homes |
| Diverse panels | At least one interviewer from underrepresented group |
| Independent scoring | Score before debrief discussion |
| Data tracking | Monitor pass rates by demographic |
| Regular audits | Quarterly review of assessment fairness |

## 8. Hiring Committee

### 8.1 Committee Structure

| Role | Responsibility | Vote Weight |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Hiring manager | Final decision authority, context | Deciding vote |
| Technical interviewer(s) | Technical assessment | Equal vote |
| Cross-functional interviewer | Collaboration, culture | Equal vote |
| Recruiter | Process, candidate experience, market context | Advisory (no vote) |
| Bar raiser (senior engineer) | Maintain hiring bar consistency | Veto power (rare) |

### 8.2 Decision Framework

| Scenario | Decision | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| All Strong Yes | Hire | Make offer immediately |
| Majority Lean Yes, no Strong No | Hire | Make offer |
| Mixed (Yes + No) | Discuss | Additional data point or pass |
| Any Strong No (with evidence) | Pass | Decline with feedback |
| All Lean No | Pass | Decline with feedback |
| Insufficient signal | Additional round | One more focused interview |

### 8.3 Debrief Protocol

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Written feedback submitted before debrief | Prevent anchoring |
| Hiring manager speaks last | Prevent authority bias |
| Focus on evidence, not feelings | Reduce gut-feel decisions |
| Disagree and commit | Once decided, support the decision |
| Document decision rationale | Learning and accountability |
