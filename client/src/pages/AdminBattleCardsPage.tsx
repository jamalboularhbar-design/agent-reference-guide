Ask them: 'How long does it take a new hire to find the right SOP?' If it's more than 30 seconds, ARG Builder pays for itself.",

        objection: "Notion is cheaper",

ARG Builder Professional at $599/mo includes AI search, analytics, knowledge graphs, and comprehension tracking — features you'd need 3-4 additional tools to replicate.",

        objection: "Our team already knows Notion",
        response: "ARG Builder's interface is intuitive — most teams are productive within 1 day. Plus, we offer a migration tool that imports Notion exports directly. The learning curve is minimal, but the operational gains are massive.",
